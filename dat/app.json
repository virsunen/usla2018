[{"model": "app.sitesettings", "pk": 1, "fields": {"site_name": "usla.ca", "site_desc": "Upper Stoney Lake Association", "site_history": "<p>It was many years ago when the Upper Stony (yes, Stony) Lake Association started. Always called the bulletin, their first newsletter was Volume 1, 1955 and \u201cpublished once in a while in the interests of Cottagers and Lodge Owners on Upper Stony Lake.\u201d The first newsletter was three pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With four officers and five directors, it was noted that \u201cIt comprises: The Landing, The North Shore, Northey\u2019s Bay, The Islands, Mouth of the Cree, South Bay, Burnham Lodge, Irwin Inn, Birchmuir Lodge, Whetung\u2019s Pavilion, Knox\u2019s, Boschink Narrows, The Duck Pond and Jack\u2019s Creek.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their bulletin was considered a new venture by the Association to keep members posted on things of interest about the lake. Although printed 62 years ago, the issues they considered serious then included \u201calgae in the water\u201d, \u201c fire protection\u201d, \u201cburglary\u201d, and \u201croad maintenance\u201d. Many of those same issues remain strong in the minds of members today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Membership to the association, at that time $1 for each family member over 18 years, was earmarked to be spent on the Regatta and upkeep of the pavilion and the maintenance of the Landing.\r\nOver the years the association has flourished and grown \u2013 grown not only in membership and issues, but also grown in the name, with an \u201ce\u201d being added to Stony. The first sign of the \u201ce\u201d was in the Regatta Notice of 1960. It appeared once again in 1965, but it was in 1972 that it became a constant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the years there have been changes in the association, ranging from activities put on, to different events in the Regatta \u2013 there are no longer boat races with a maximum 6HP motor powering your boat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1900s a trip to the cottage from as close as 14 miles away was a day-long event. Today even flying from Europe, you will get to the cottage just as quickly. Membership invoices are now emailed and payments sent by Internet transfers. Websites and Facebook bring news to people within mere minutes. There have been many bulletins produced over the years, although now on a somewhat more consistent basis. The membership has fluctuated and prices have increased. People now live at their \u201ccottages\u201d 12 months of the year; some even fly in for the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is, however, one constant that has been evident throughout these many years. That is the dedication of members and volunteers to the lake. The environment has always been a concern, as has the water quality. Today\u2019s cottagers, residents, members and volunteers are dedicated to helping preserve forever what brought people to our lake in the first place. The beautiful views; the comradery of friends and neighbours; the life-long bonds created; the sight of rolling waves and the sounds of nature are just part of what makes Stoney Lake so special.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><i>Shelagh Landsmann / June 2017</i></h5>", "site_history_lbl": "History of USLA", "contact": "info@usla.ca", "facebook_link": "https://www.facebook.com/UpperStoneyLakeAssociation", "logo_header_image": "images/site/usla_regata_logo-header.png", "logo_btm_image": "images/site/usla_logo_red_yellow_212_105_kkSlC8R.png"}}, {"model": "app.boardpositions", "pk": "Director -

The feedback from the membership on our expanded mandate was positive, and we will be moving forward this spring with establishing a committee of those who volunteered to ensure that we are more involved in monitoring and participating in projects/policies that will affect the lake.</p>\r\n<p>This year in addition to our regular children and youth activities (swimming, regatta, dances, land sports and movie nights), Camp Kawartha will be running a free two-day camp on August 21, and 22 for 5 to 12-year old\u2019s with activities focused on environmental education in action. Their hope is to provide a week-long camp in 2018 similar to the camp currently running at Juniper. Information about registration is contained in this Bulletin. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Raymont has once again donated his film, \u201cYukon Wild\u201d to be previewed at the Pavilion. We would like to thank Peter for his time and generosity every year. Check this year\u2019s summer schedule for other social and information events at the Pavilion. \r\nWe are working to have a new website up and running for the summer in the hope that we can move away from paper communication in the near future. </p>\r\n<p>This year is Canada\u2019s 150th birthday, and we will be celebrating on the July 1st weekend with a family dance on July 1 and fireworks on Sunday, July 2nd. Our AGM will be in the 1st with the Craft Sale following on the 2nd. </p>\r\n<p>Finally, as this is my last President\u2019s message, I am more keenly aware of our responsibility as a board to involve the next generation of cottagers to ensure the USLA continues to be an engaging and energetic organization. We will be reaching out to all around the lake who are current, past or future members highlighting the benefits of membership and the importance of the continued involvement of a variety of ages and interests in the running of the association. We welcome any and all assistance and/or ideas about how we can continue to maintain the association as an important part of the Stoney Lake experience.</p>\r\n<p>Have a safe and happy summer on the lake.</p>\r\n<h5><i>Elizabeth Hyde</i></h5>", "page_order": 0}}, {"model": "app.page", "pk": "Membership", "fields": {"slug": "membership", "fa_icon": "fa-group", "sub_description": "The Title Description", "image": "images/pages/membership/usla_membership_sml.png", "description": "<p>Membership Page</p>", "page_order": 3}}, {"model": "app.page", "pk": "News", "fields": {"slug": "news", "fa_icon": "fa-newspaper-o", "sub_description": "News & Announcements from the USLA Community", "image": "images/pages/news/usla_contact.png", "description": "News & Announcements from the USLA Community", "page_order": 4}}, {"model": "app.page", "pk": "Programs", "fields": {"slug": "programs", "fa_icon": "fa-pencil-square", "sub_description": "2017 -  USLA Programs", "image": "images/pages/programs/usla_programs.png", "description": "We have lots of exciting....", "page_order": 2}}, {"model": "app.program", "pk": 0, "fields": {"name": "Golf", "description": "", "image": "", "pdf_file": "", "fa_icon": "fa-flag", "start_date": "2017-07-03", "end_date": "2017-08-28", "sub_description": "", "contact_name": "", "contact_email": "", "contact_tel": "", "author": null}}, {"model": "app.program", "pk": 1, "fields": {"name": "Swimming", "description": "We are excited that some of our Instructors and many of our volunteers are returning this summer!
